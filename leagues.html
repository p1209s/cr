                        In March 2017, <strong><em>"Leagues"</em></strong> were added to the game. Once above 4000 trophies, players are placed in one of nine different leagues ranging from Challenger I to Ultimate Champion. At the end of each season,
                        players receive rewards based on the highest league achieved during that season. After the season ends the player is reset to half of the trophies they gained above 4000 trophies. So if they got to 6400 they would be reset to 5200
                        trophies at the end of the season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another feature that was introduced is Clan Battles. Two players get to battle side by side with another member of their clan facing off against two other opponents from another clan. This is the first update to include a new game mode.
