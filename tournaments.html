                    In July 2016, Supercell introduced a new <strong><em>Tournament</em></strong> feature. Tournaments are similar to normal battles, but all cards are capped at level 9. This feature is unlocked at player experience Level 5, but can only
                    be played from experience level 8. Tournaments can only be created by using gems, and the creator can choose to make it password protected or open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on tournament performance, players are rewarded with tournament chests. As well as tournaments, there are two types of Victory Challenges, one in which the goal is to win twelve times while losing no more than two times and the other's goal is to
                    play until you finish the entire challenge by winning all crowns or battles, regardless of losses.</p>
                <p>
                    A Grand Challenge costs 100 gems to enter, and a Classic Challenge costs 10. Completing (or getting 12 wins on) a Grand Challenge gives you 22000 gold and 1100 cards, and completing a Classic Challenge will give you 2000 gold and 100 cards. Supercell
                    has also added various event challenges, for limited periods of time, that add special features to the battles, or allow players to receive special cards. These event challenges can also sometimes be played in Friendly Battles.

                    As of the October 2017 update, players would no longer get a refund on gems if no matches take place in their custom tournaments. In December 2018 update added Global Tournaments while Custom Tournaments is renamed to Private Tournaments which removed
                    the prizes but added more options.
